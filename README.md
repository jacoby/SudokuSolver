# Sudoku Solver

This is a program that takes a Sudoku Puzzle and solves it recursively using 
brute force.

## INSTALLATION

Uses pure perl, with no modules

## TODO

* uses the __DATA__ section of the program to load a puzzle. Needs a way to import from external files. 

* This is my first-pass brute force method. Certainly there are more clever techniques for solving sudoku.
